# Gateway Service

## Overview
A microservices gateway that provides a unified API interface for clients and handles request routing/distribution to the appropriate microservices.

## Features
- Single entry point for all client requests
- Request routing and load balancing
- Service discovery and registration
- Request/response transformation
- Authentication and authorization
- Rate limiting and throttling
- Monitoring and logging

## Architecture
The gateway acts as a reverse proxy, intercepting incoming client requests and forwarding them to the appropriate backend microservices based on the request path and configuration.
